## Introduction

Clerk is a developer-first authentication and user management solution. It provides pre-built React components and hooks for sign-in, sign-up, user profile, and organization management. Clerk is designed to be easy to use and customize, and can be dropped into any React or Next.js application.

Clerk organizations are a way of grouping your application's users. Organizations are shared accounts, useful for project and team leaders â€” think of GitHub Teams, or the different departments of a company.

This starter project shows how to use [Clerk](https://www.clerk.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=starter_repos&utm_campaign=organizations_starter) with Next.js to build a rather lean interface, showcasing the power of the [organizations feature](https://clerk.com/docs/organizations/overview?utm_source=github&utm_medium=starter_repos&utm_campaign=organizations_starter).

## Live Demo
